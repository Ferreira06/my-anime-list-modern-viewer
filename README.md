## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Docker

The easiest and recommended way to run this application is with Docker. This ensures the environment is consistent and allows the app to run as a persistent background service on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- You must have **Docker Desktop** installed and running on your computer.

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone or download the project files** to a directory on your computer. Ensure you have the `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, and `docker-compose.yml` files in the root directory.

2.  **Open your terminal** (like PowerShell, Command Prompt, or Terminal on Mac/Linux) and navigate to the project's root directory.

3.  **Build the Docker image** by running the following command. This will read the `Dockerfile`, install all dependencies, and build the Next.js application.
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```

4.  **Run the container** in detached (background) mode. This command starts the application and ensures it will restart automatically if you reboot your computer.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5.  **Done!** The application is now running. You can access it in your web browser by navigating to:
    **[http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545)**
